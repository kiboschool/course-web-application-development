## Tools

In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up
your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in
[https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides).

* **Github** is a website that hosts code. We'll use it as a place to keep our project and assignment code.
* **Github Classroom** is a tool for assigning individual and team projects on Github. 
* **VSCode** is your code editor. It's where you'll write code to solve
    programming assignments. It also has an embedded terminal, where you can run
    Python to try out your code and test that it works.
* **Gradescope** is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment
    submissions and give you feedback on your work.
* **Woolf** is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that
    you get credit towards your degree.
