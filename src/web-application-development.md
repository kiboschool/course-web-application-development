**CSF005**

_6 ECTS Credits_

Prerequisites: CSF004 Web Foundations

## Welcome to Web Application Development

<!-- welcome video -->

## What you'll learn

This course builds on Web Foundations, and provides a comprehensive introduction to client and server-side development for the web. 

In this project-based course, you will work independently to build web applications, and progressively apply new knowledge to your projects. You will deepen your knowledge of HTML and learn advanced CSS, including how to use CSS variables and modern frameworks for motion and interaction. You will learn about accessible web design, and how to create websites and apps that work well on mobile devices, and that support use of assistive technologies like screen readers.

You will build the front-end of a web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and write a supporting back-end using a JavaScript or Python framework. In doing so, you will demonstrate knowledge of the request-response cycle, database management, and JSON-based APIs. You will also apply technical communication skills by writing technical specs, drafting architecture diagrams, and documenting APIs.

## Tools

In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up
your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in
[https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides).

* **Github** is a website that hosts code. We'll use it as a place to keep our project and assignment code.
* **Github Classroom** is a tool for assigning individual and team projects on Github. 
* **VSCode** is your code editor. It's where you'll write code to solve
    programming assignments. It also has an embedded terminal, where you can run
    Python to try out your code and test that it works.
* **Chrome** is a web browser we'll use to debug our applications. Other
    browsers may have similar features, but the course is designed to be
    completed using Chrome.
* **Gradescope** is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment
    submissions and give you feedback on your work.
* **Woolf** is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that
    you get credit towards your degree.
