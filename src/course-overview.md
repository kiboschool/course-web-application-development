## What you'll learn

This course builds on Web Foundations, and provides a comprehensive introduction to client and server-side development for the web. 

In this project-based course, you will work independently to build web applications, and progressively apply new knowledge to your projects. You will deepen your knowledge of HTML and learn advanced CSS, including how to use CSS variables and modern frameworks for motion and interaction. You will learn about accessible web design, and how to create websites and apps that work well on mobile devices, and that support use of assistive technologies like screen readers.

You will build the front-end of a web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and write a supporting back-end using a JavaScript or Python framework. In doing so, you will demonstrate knowledge of the request-response cycle, database management, and JSON-based APIs. You will also apply technical communication skills by writing technical specs, drafting architecture diagrams, and documenting APIs.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive websites
- Describe and implement common web accessibility practices 
- Design and implement mobile-first principles to build responsive websites
