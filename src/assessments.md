# Assessments

Your overall course grade is made up of the following:

- Practice Exercises: 10%
- Weekly Assignments: 40%
- Midterm Project: 25%
- Final Project: 25%

## Practice Exercises

Each week will include practice exercises to help you better understand web
applications. You are _strongly_ encouraged to complete the practice exercises
each week. They will be graded based on completion, not correctness. Submitting
any of the practice exercises for a given week will count towards the practice
exercise grade for the course. You are required to submit ten exercises throughout the term.

### Practice Exercise Submission

You are required to submit documentation for 10 practice exercises over the
course of the term. Each one will count for 1/10 of your practice grade, or 1%
of your overall grade.

* Practice exercises will be graded for _completion_ not _correctness_. You have
to document that you did the work, but we won't be checking if you got it right.
* You are welcome to log practice that is not one of the exercises listed on the 
practice page.
* You can submit a link to a github repo, a replit, a Google doc, or some other 
resource.
* Each entry in the form will count for one of your ten required practice entries.

Your submission will count for credit, as long as it:
* is accessible to your instructor, and
* is a demonstration of your own work.


### Why Practice?

Practice coding helps you become a great coder. These practice problems aren't
graded, but that doesn't mean they aren't important.

You should aim to practice a lot, especially with unfamiliar concepts. Spread practice over multiple days to take advantage of the _spacing effect_, which helps you retain new knowledge.

Practice helps you understand what you know, and what you don't know. It can be easy to trick yourself into thinking you understand something when you
do not -- or that you don't understand when you do. Practicing by writing code
or debugging code will help you find out what you really understand, and where
you are still confused.

Practice helps build confidence in your coding. The more programs you write, and
the more problems you solve, the more you learn that you are a capable coder and
problem-solver.

Practice doesn't always feel good - sometimes you'll be stumped! But, practice
shouldn't feel super frustrating either. If you find yourself getting angry at
yourself or the code, it's a good time to take a break and ask for help. 

On the flip side, if practice feels too easy, it means you aren't challenging yourself
enough. If the practice problems early in the course are not challenging for
you, you should seek additional challenges.

## Assignments

Each week you will be given an Assignment, where you'll practice the concepts
covered in the readings and lessons.  The assignments let you practice with the topics you covered that week, explore applications and connections, and check your own understanding of the material.

## Projects

You will have a midterm project and a final project in this course.  Projects are larger in scale and will
give you an opportunity to work with larger amounts of code to solve more complex problems.  You will be given two weeks to complete each project.  They represent a significant portion of your grade, and so it is important that you start these projects as early as possible.  

## Submission

All of your work must be submitted in Gradescope and Anchor.

For projects with a Github link, you should also push the latest version of 
your code to Github Classroom.

This video shows how to get assignment code onto your computer, and how to
submit it to Github Classroom.

## Late Policy

The assignments in the course build on each other. It is important to turn
your work in on time, both for your own learning, and as a matter of
professionalism.

If you know that you will not be able to submit an assignment on time, please
contact the instructor to provide the reason and ask for an extension. Note that you need to notify the instructor before the assignment is due.

In general, the penalty for late submission of an assignment is 10% of the
assignment grade, per week that the assignment is late, with a max penalty of
50% per assignment.
