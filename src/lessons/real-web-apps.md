# Real Web Apps

Real software is alive.

Much of the code you've written so far will not end up running for very long.
The applications and services that people use tend to run for a long time, often
years or decades.

That has a lot of implications. Instead of optimizing for ease of setting up, 
systems are optimized for maintenance. Most of the job of software engineers 
isn't building something from scratch, it's maintaining, fixing, and updating 
existing code.

This week, you'll learn a bit about the real-world considerations that impact
software development. You'll also spend time exploring real-world application
code from open-source projects, and catalog patterns you notice, as well as
similarities and differences from the web applications you've worked on this
term.
