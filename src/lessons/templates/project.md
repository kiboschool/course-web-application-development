# Project: Number Guessing Game

_Due Date: Jan 27_

> This is an **individual project**. You are expected to submit your own solution,
> not to work with a partner or team.

## Number Guessing Game

In this project, you'll build a number guessing game using Flask. You'll
practice the basics common to all web applications: routing and templating.

The game will work similarly to the Guess My Number game you have seen in past
courses. There is a secret number, the user is prompted to guess, and the app
tells them if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
