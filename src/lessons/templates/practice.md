### Submission

You are required to submit documentation for 10 practice exercises over the
course of the term. Each one will count for 1/10 of your practice grade, or 1%
of your overall grade.

To log your practice for credit:

> **[Submit a link using this form](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/575913/assignments/3423197)**

* Practice exercises will be graded for _completion_ not _correctness_. You have
to document that you did the work, but we won't be checking if you got it right.
* You are welcome to log practice that is not one of the exercises listed on the 
practice page.
* You can submit a link to a github repo, a replit, a Google doc, or some other 
resource.

Your log will count for credit as long as it:
- is accessible to your instructor
- shows your own work

## Flask FizzBuzz

Practice your Jinja templating by creating a FizzBuzz app in Flask.

Here are the requirements:

- The app should have one route, `/fizzbuzz`, that renders an HTML template.
- In the template, loop through the numbers 1 to 100 inside of an unordered
    list.
- For every number that is divisible by 3, show a list element with the word
    'Fizz'
- For every number that is divisible by 5, show a list element with the word
    'Buzz'
- For every number that is divisible by both 3 and 5, show a list element with
    'FizzBuzz'
- For every other number, show a list element with the number
