## Flask FizzBuzz

Practice your Jinja templating by creating a FizzBuzz app in Flask.

Here are the requirements:

- The app should have one route, `/fizzbuzz`, that renders an HTML template.
- In the template, loop through the numbers 1 to 100 inside of an unordered
    list.
- For every number that is divisible by 3, show a list element with the word
    'Fizz'
- For every number that is divisible by 5, show a list element with the word
    'Buzz'
- For every number that is divisible by both 3 and 5, show a list element with
    'FizzBuzz'
- For every other number, show a list element with the number
