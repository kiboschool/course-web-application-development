# Midterm Project: Quiz App

In this project, you'll build a custom quiz app using Flask.

<!--

## Quiz Apps

Quiz apps are really popular.

[Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/world?t=world), for instance, offers
tons of different types of quizzes, usually with a timer.

Have you ever taken a Buzzfeed-style Quiz? If you haven't (or even if you have),
take a look at [These Disney Channel And K-Pop Songs Have The Same Title â€” Which 
Do You Prefer?](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sagehaley/disney-channel-vs-kpop-songs). The quiz isn't really about knowing anything or getting the answer right, it's
about entertainment.

[Mentimeter](https://www.menti.com/) is a quiz app for education, and 
[SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) is a quiz app for
surveys for businesses.

In this project, you'll use what you've learned so far about web apps to make 
your own quiz app. You can pick any style - you don't have to follow the style 
any of these apps.

## Requirements

- Your application must use Flask
- Your application must render a quiz using a template
- Your application must allow users to answer questions using a form
- Your application must handle the response to the form, and show the user their
    results

## Optional

- You may add styles to the quiz app pages
- You may use a CSS framework
- You may render questions from a fixed list in your code, or from a database
