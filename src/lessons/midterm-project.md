# Midterm Project: Quiz App

_Due Date: Feb 5_

In this project, you'll build a custom quiz app using Flask.

<!--
> This is a **Team Project**. You'll work in groups of **2-3 students** to
> design and build your application.
>
> 1. Form your groups and communicate with your team before you accept the
>    assignment in Github Classroom.
> 2. Join the same team in Github Classroom. Work on your project together.
>    Ideally, find a time when you can all join a video call and work together on
>    the project. Everyone in the group should have a roughly equal contribution
>    to the project.
> 3. Submit your project as a group in Gradescope.

Quiz apps are really popular.

[Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/world?t=world), for instance, offers
tons of different types of quizzes, usually with a timer.

Have you ever taken a Buzzfeed-style Quiz? If you haven't (or even if you have),
take a look at [These Disney Channel And K-Pop Songs Have The Same Title â€” Which 
Do You Prefer?](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sagehaley/disney-channel-vs-kpop-songs). The quiz isn't really about knowing anything or getting the answer right, it's
about entertainment.

[Mentimeter](https://www.menti.com/) is a quiz app for education, and 
[SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/) is a quiz app for
surveys for businesses.

In this project, you'll use what you've learned so far about web apps to make 
your own quiz app. You can pick any style - you don't have to follow the style 
any of these apps.

## Requirements

- Your application must use Flask
- Your application must render a quiz using a template
- Your application must allow users to answer questions using a form
- Your application must handle the response to the form, and show the user their
    results

## Optional

- You may add styles to the quiz app pages
- You may use a CSS framework
- You may render questions from a fixed list in your code, or from a database

## Submission

1. Commit and push your project to Github.
2. Submit your project in Gradescope (as a team).
3. Upload your work to Woolf (each team member should upload the files to
   Woolf).
