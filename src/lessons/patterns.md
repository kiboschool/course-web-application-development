# Patterns

There is a lot more to learn about web applications. This week, you'll touch on
a few disparate topics that make developers lives easier as they build and

You won't end this week an expert in each of these topics, but you will learn
enough to recognize the terms and build a list of further ideas and concepts to
explore after the course.

## Topics

- Responsive Design
- ORMs
- Database indexes
- Testing
