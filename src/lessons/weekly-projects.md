# Weekly Projects

Each week, you'll be given a project involving the new skills and concepts you
learned. This page lists all of weekly assigned projects.

The projects will be challenging, and it's recommended that you complete the
material and practice problems before you start the project each week.

There will also be a midterm project and a final project, described on the next
pages.
