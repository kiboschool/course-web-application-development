## SQLite

- Great for the apps we're building
- Doesn't require running a separate process
- Ships with Python
- Apps we're building in this class don't require multiple parallel connections

## Postgres, MySQL, etc.

- Default for larger applications
- Mostly similar behavior, but with some differences
- Later in the class, we'll learn how to install, setup, and deploy them
