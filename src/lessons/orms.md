# ORMs

Writing raw SQL queries can be tedious and complicated. This is where ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) comes into play, simplifying database interactions for developers.

#### Advantages of ORMs over Raw SQL

1. **Simplicity**: Instead of dealing with rows, columns, and SQL queries, developers work with classes and objects, which aligns with the object-oriented paradigm.
  
2. **Security**: ORMs often come with built-in security features, such as protection against SQL injection attacks.
  
3. **Database Independence**: ORM provides a level of abstraction, making it easier to switch between different database systems without rewriting much of your code.

4. **Automation**: Tasks like connection management and schema updates can be handled more efficiently.

In the following lessons, we will explore in deepness how do they work.
