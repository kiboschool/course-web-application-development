# Deploying express apps

As we covered before, we will be using [render.com](http://render.com) to deploy apps.

Follow the steps on [this link](https://render.com/docs/deploy-node-express-app).

While creating your file apps, pay special attention to the files `package.json` and `app.js`.  These two files are the one responsible for specifying all the dependencies of your app (like express) and handling all the code of your app, respectively.
