# Routing and Templating

Welcome to this week's exciting journey into the world of web development! As we dive deeper into web applications, it's essential to understand how we present content to our users. This brings us to the concept of **templating**.

**2. Templating:** 
At the heart of every dynamic web application lies a robust templating system. This system ensures that the content we serve is not only dynamic but also organized and efficient.

**2.1. What are templates?** 
We'll start by demystifying what templates are and how they act as the presentation backbone of our web apps.

**2.2. Static files:** 
While dynamic content is crucial, static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images play a pivotal role in improving user experience. We'll  understand how and where to store these files, and how they integrate with our templates.
