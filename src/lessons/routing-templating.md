**Routing** is how you set your app up to respond to different HTTP requests
based on the _path_ and the _HTTP verb_. Different requests need different
responses!

**Templates** are a way to render custom HTML based on some code. They let you
use variables in HTML before it's sent to the user, so that you can show
different content, depending on the user or the state of the application. 

With these two concepts, you'll be able to start building real web applications.
