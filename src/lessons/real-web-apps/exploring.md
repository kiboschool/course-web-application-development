# Exploring Real Web Apps

'Real' web applications are different from the applications you've worked with in this course. They follow the same principles, but they tend to be much larger, much longer-lived, and have much larger teams working on them. They also have users! All of those factors change the way the code tends to look.

## Pair instructions (Live class activity)

- Find a partner, each take one application
- Spend 5 minutes exploring the application on your own
  - Take ten minutes to explain the application you investigated to your partner.
- Walk through the answers to the questions on the form you filled out, and
    show where in the code for the application you found the answers
- Swap with your partner, and have them share their explanations with you
- Together, note what answers you found in common between the applications, and
    what answers were different
