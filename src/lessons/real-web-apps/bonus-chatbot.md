# Bonus Project: AI Chatbot

In this optional project, you'll follow a tutorial to build an AI chatbot application.

There are several resources and tutorials to follow, based on which tools you want to use, what kind of chatbot interface you want to build, and what skills you want to practice.


## Discord x ChatGPT

This version of a chatbot uses Discord as the UI for the chatbot, and ChatGPT from OpenAI as the machine-learned model to converse with.

There are several resources, tutorials, and walkthroughs you can rely on to build a Discord-ChatGPT bot.

The application will use the OpenAI API and the Discord API, so you will need to create API keys for each of those tools.

- [OpenAI's sample GPT Discord bot](https://github.com/openai/gpt-discord-bot)
- Text-based tutorials from [Coding the smart way](https://www.codingthesmartway.com/creating-a-discord-chatbot-with-chatgpt/) and [Better Programming](https://betterprogramming.pub/add-an-ai-to-your-discord-server-with-node-js-and-gpt-3-198b538cc05b)

You can also rely on the documentation from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart/build-your-application)
and [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs).

## A ChatGPT web interface (without Discord)

Instead of connecting ChatGPT to Discord, you can build a web interface that hosts the chat UI.

Depending on the tools you want to use, pick an appropriate tutorial.

- [Express (JS)](https://codesnippet.io/openai-completions-api-tutorial/) 
- [Gradio (Python)](https://beebom.com/how-build-own-ai-chatbot-with-chatgpt-api/)

## Without ChatGPT

While OpenAI's ChatGPT is a powerful language model, there are other options.

Here's a tutorial using [Chatterbot](https://realpython.com/build-a-chatbot-python-chatterbot/), another natural language processing library.

If you forgo a pre-built machine learning library, you'll have more work to do (a lot more work) to train the underlying AI model. However, you'll also learn more about AI and Deep Learning if you put in the effort.

If you have the time, try out these tutorials to get under the hood of the ML systems:
