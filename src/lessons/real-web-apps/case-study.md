# Assignment: Case Study

_Due Date: Mar 17_

> This is an **individual project**. You are expected to submit your own solution,
> not to work with a partner or team.

'Real' web applications are different from the applications you've worked with
in this course. They follow the same principles, but they tend to be much
larger, much longer-lived, and have much larger teams working on them. They also
have users! All of those factors change the way the code tends to look.

For your final assignment, you will investigate a real-world web application, and
answer questions about how it works. You'll get to see for yourself the
differences between the applications you've worked with so far in this course,
and the codebases for applications that people use.

## Instructions

- Pick an application to investigate
- Follow the links to read more about the application
- Answer the questions about your chosen application

## Applications

Choose one of the following applications to investigate:

- [TLDraw](/lessons/real-web-apps/tldraw.md)
- [OTW and AO3](/lessons/real-web-apps/otw.md)
- [Matrix Element](/lessons/real-web-apps/element.md)
- [MediaWiki](/lessons/real-web-apps/mediawiki.md)
- [Ghost and Wordpress](/lessons/real-web-apps/ghost-wordpress.md)
- [Flask and Express](/lessons/real-web-apps/flask-express.md)

Alternatively, you can find another large, open-source web application project
to investigate. The code for the project must be open source, and the project
must be active. You should confirm with your instructor that the application is
appropriate.

## Pair instructions (Live class activity)

- Find a partner who chose a different application
- Take ten minutes to explain the application you investigated to your partner.
- Walk through the answers to the questions on the form you filled out, and
    show where in the code for the application you found the answers
- Swap with your partner, and have them share their explanations with you
- Together, note what answers you found in common between the applications, and
    what answers were different
