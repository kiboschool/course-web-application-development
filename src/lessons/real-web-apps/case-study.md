For your final assignment, you will investigate two real-world web applications, and answer questions about how they work. You'll get to see for yourself the similarities and differences between the applications you've worked with so far in this course and the codebases for living applications with thousands of users.

## Instructions

- Follow the links to read more about the applications
- Clone the application, install dependencies, and follow the Getting started instructions to run the code on your laptop
- Answer the questions about each application

## Redash

Redash is an open-source browser-based data tool. From the description:

> Redash is designed to enable anyone, regardless of the level of technical sophistication, to harness the power of data big and small.
