# APIs

Web applications don't live in isolation. They often work together with other
applications.

For instance, if you have an online store, it might use Google or Facebook to
let users log in, then use Flutterwave or Paystack for checkout.

To connect your application to those applications, you make use of an
_interface_. An _Application Programming Interface_, or API, is how an
application communicates with other programs.

Every API is different, but there are skills you can learn that make it easier
each time you have to deal with a new API. Practicing with different APIs and
designing your own API will help you get a handle on how to connect your
application to other services.

You'll practice reading and writing documentation, navigating API
authentication, and patterns like webhooks and rate limiting.
