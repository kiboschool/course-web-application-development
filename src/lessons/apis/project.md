# Assignment: Product Info

In this assignment, you'll be updating a Flipkart clone so that it
serves data as an API in addition to rendering HTML pages. Then, you'll
update the search feature. 

The Flipkart clone is an e-commerce website built using Flask, SQLite3, and SQLAlchemy.
SQLAlchemy is a Python based ORM, most commonly used with Flask applications (just like we used Prisma for our  Express Apps). 

Although a deep understanding of the SQLAlchemy ORM is not required for the assignment, the assignment expects you to explore use of this ORM in a web application. This will help to deepen your understanding of ORMs in general, as you navigate another ORM similar to Prisma.

It would help you if you go through this [link](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/essential-sqlalchemy/9780596516147/ch01.html) to have an overview of the SQLALchemy ORM for a good understanding of how it works. This would also help you better understand how the Flipkart clone for the assignment works.
