A web application is a software application that runs on the web. In this 
course, you'll learn how web apps work, and how to build them using different 
languages. 

This week is about the big picture: _how do web apps work in general?_ You'll 
learn:

- What are web apps and web servers?
- HTTP, the protocol behind the web
- URLs, the addresses for content on the web
- The request-response cycle
- The client-server model

For this week's assignment, you'll also conduct a tour of some example web 
applications. The examples are written in different languages, and they use 
different frameworks. You'll explore how they work, answer some questions about 
them, and learn how run them on your own computer.
