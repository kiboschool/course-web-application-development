# Web Apps

A web application is a software application that runs on the web.

In this course, you'll learn how web apps work, and how to build them using
different languages. This week is about the big picture: how do web apps work in
general?

You'll learn

- HTTP, the protocol behind the web 
- The request-response cycle
- The client-server model
- The MVC architecture

This week, you'll also conduct a _tour_ of web applications, written in
different languages, using different frameworks. You'll explore how they work,
answer questions about them, and learn how run them on your own computer.
