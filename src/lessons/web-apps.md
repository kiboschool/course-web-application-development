# Introduction to Web Application Development

Welcome to the Web Application Development course! Whether you're an experienced developer or just getting your feet wet in the world of web development, this course is designed to equip you with the skills needed to create robust, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. Let's briefly explore the topics we'll be covering:

## What are Web Apps?

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of coding, it's crucial to understand what a web application is. Unlike static websites, web apps are dynamic and interactive platforms built to perform specific tasks. They could range from simple to-do lists to complex e-commerce platforms.

## Intro to Flask

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It provides the essential functionalities required to build web applications but leaves the rest up to you, ensuring that you have the flexibility to make your app as simple or complex as you want. We'll cover setting up a Flask project, its folder structure, and its key components like routes and templates.

## Deploying Apps

Once an application is developed, the next crucial step is to deploy it to a server. We'll look at various deployment options, including cloud-based solutions, to make your application accessible to users worldwide.

## URLs

Understanding the structure and functionality of URLs is critical for web development. They act as the gateway to the content of your application, so we'll cover how they work and their role in directing users within your app.

## Routing in Flask

Flask makes it incredibly straightforward to define routesâ€”essentially, the different pages or endpoints in your application. We'll dive into how to define routes, handle URL parameters, and create dynamic URLs.

## Query VS URL Params

Both query parameters and URL parameters are used to capture user input. Although they can sometimes serve similar purposes, they are different in terms of syntax and use-cases. We'll explore these differences in detail.

## Web App Architecture

Designing a scalable and efficient application requires a good understanding of web architecture. We'll look at how the client-server model works, where Flask fits into the picture, and the role of databases, among other topics.
