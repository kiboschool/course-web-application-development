_Due Date: Feb 21_ 

> This is a **Team Project**. You'll work in groups of **2-3 students** to
> design and build your application.
>
> 1. Form your groups and communicate with your team before you accept the
>    assignment in Github Classroom.
> 2. Join the same team in Github Classroom. Work on your project together.
>    Ideally, find a time when you can all join a video call and work together on
>    the project. Everyone in the group should have a roughly equal contribution
>    to the project.
> 3. Submit your project as a group in Gradescope.

In this assignment, you'll be updating a the product page application so that it
uses data from the database, instead of drawing on hard-coded data. Then, you'll
update the search feature so that it includes a 'browse by category' feature.

You'll need to rely on what you've learned about SQL and data modeling in order
to write the queries needed for the category browsing feature.
