# Assignment: Product Info

In this assignment, you'll be updating a the product page application so that it
uses data from the database, instead of drawing on hard-coded data. Then, you'll
update the search feature so that it includes a 'browse by category' feature.

You'll need to rely on what you've learned about SQL and data modeling in order
to write the queries needed for the category browsing feature.
