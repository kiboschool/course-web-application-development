> Try solving these practice challenges to check that you understand the concepts.

### Submission

You are required to submit documentation for 10 practice exercises over the
course of the term. Each one will count for 1/10 of your practice grade, or 1%
of your overall grade.

To log your practice for credit:

> **[Submit a link using this form](https://forms.gle/z8GVWpkbPAtsu4b98)**

* Practice exercises will be graded for _completion_ not _correctness_. You have
to document that you did the work, but we won't be checking if you got it right.
* You are welcome to log practice that is not one of the exercises listed on the 
practice page.
* You can submit a link to a github repo, a replit, a Google doc, or some other 
resource.

Your log will count for credit as long as it:
- is accessible to your instructor
- shows your own work

## Writing an form, end to end

> Practice building a form from scratch

1. Create a new flask application, either using a Replit template or by creating a new directory with a file called app.py and a `templates/` folder.
2. Create a route handler to show a form using a template.
3. Write the form in the template, including several inputs, a submit button, and the `method` and `action` attributes on the form itself.
4. Write a handler function that handles submitting the form and saving the data to a sqlite3 database.
5. Write a handler function that displays all the items created in the database.

## Employee data validation

Bad data has gotten into our application! We need your help to fix it, and update the application so that no more bad data gets added.
