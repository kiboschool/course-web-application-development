# Styling Forms

As you've seen in these lessons, forms are complicated! That's even more true when it comes to styling. 

A big reason for the complexity is that forms are made of so many interacting pieces with specific behavior. They've also evolved over time, adding new features and more complexity.

For a history on the form specification and how browser-native forms have grown, see this [article from Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/11/standardizing-select-native-html-form-controls/).

## Styling forms

## Styling input elements

### Text inputs

### Other inputs

### Select

Select boxes are hard to style! 

See the [MDN guide on styling select](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select#styling_with_css)

```html
<select name="color" id="color">
  <option disabled selected>Choose a color</option>
  <option value="red">Red</option>
  <option value="green">Green</option>
  <option value="blue">Blue</option>
</select>
```

- To set the initially selected option, use the attribute `selected`
- To make an option appear in the list, but not be allowed to be submitted, use the `disabled` attribute
