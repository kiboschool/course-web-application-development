# Accessibility

Accessible websites are ones that everyone can use. They are understandable (even if you can't see, or see in color), they are navigable (using either the keyboard or mouse), and they try to make things as clear as possible for the user -- especially when they ask the user to input data.

Forms are a particularly important thing to design well. While many pages on a site can have design issues, no issues are as painful to users as form design issues.

Here are the core rules for designing accessible forms:

- Use the appropriate semantic elements, especially for form inputs
- Label the form inputs
- Highlight the inputs on focus (this is done by default -- don't disable it!)
- Break long forms into labeled sections
- Show meaningful error messages, close to the inputs
- Lay out form inputs vertically (not left to right)
- Enable autocomplete

Below, we'll cover some of these topics.
