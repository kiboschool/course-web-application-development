# Assignment: SQL Injection

_Due Date: Feb 14_ 

> This is an **individual project**. You are expected to submit your own solution,
> not to work with a partner or team.

In this assignment, you'll use what you've learned about SQL injection to craft 
an attack against a route in an application.

Then, you'll update the code in the application so that it's safe against SQL
injection queries.
