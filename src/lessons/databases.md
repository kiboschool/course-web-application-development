# Databases

Web applications need to store data.

Instead of keeping the data in program memory (where it would get lost when the
application restarts) or saving it to a file, web applications typically store
information in databases.

In this week, we'll focus on _relational_ databases. In the begining of the week, we will only learn about `SQL` alone, then we will learn how to use `SQL` and `Flask` all together.

While there are some use
cases for other styles of database, relational databases are more generally
applicable, and illustrate many of the principles you'd need to know to use a
non-relational database.

To start, we'll focus on selecting data from tables in SQLite, a database that
is both powerful and simple to use. Later on, you'll learn how to create,
update, and delete data, as well as how to manage the structure of the data
that's stored in the database.
