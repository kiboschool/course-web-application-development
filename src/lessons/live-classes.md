# Live Classes

Each live class will have notes here that you should read before attending class.
Video recordings of the class will also be posted after the classes each week.

To access the code, you'll need to have joined the github classroom org and been
added to the team. Once you've joined the Github team by accepting an assignment
in github classroom, you can reach out in Discord to be added to the team.
