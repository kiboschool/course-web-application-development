# Project: AI Chatbot

_Due Date: Feb 17_

> This is an **individual project**. You are expected to submit your own solution,
> not to work with a partner or team.

In this assignment, you'll follow the tutorial to build an AI chatbot
application.

The application will use the OpenAI API and the Discord API, so you will need to
create API keys for each of those tools.

You'll rely on the documentation from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart/build-your-application)
and [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs).
