# Bonus Project: AI Chatbot

In this assignment, you'll follow the tutorial to build an AI chatbot application.

The application will use the OpenAI API and the Discord API, so you will need to create API keys for each of those tools.

You'll rely on the documentation from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart/build-your-application)
and [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs).
