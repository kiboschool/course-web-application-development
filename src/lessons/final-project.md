# Final Project: Multi-model CRUD App

For your final project, you'll work with a team to design and build a complete web 
application.

## Team Formation

> This is a **Team Project**. You'll work in groups of **2-3 students** to
> design and build your application.
>
> 1. You are expected to work with the same group as you did for your mid-term project. If you need to change your group for any reason, then reach out to the instructor.
> 2. Join the same team in Github Classroom. Work on your project together. Ideally, find a time when you can all join a video call and work together on the project. Everyone in the group should have a roughly equal contribution to the project.
> 3. Submit your project as a group in Gradescope.

[**Join the project on Github Classroom**](https://github.com/kiboschool/wad-crud-app)

**Note**: Do not join a team you have not communicated with ahead of time. If someone joins your team without communicating with you, please reach out to the instructor.
