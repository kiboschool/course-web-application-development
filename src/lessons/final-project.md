- Your application must have multiple related database models
- Your application must have features to Create, Read, Update, and Delete at least some of those models from a web interface
- Your application must be designed such that it works properly on different devices (desktop and mobile)

## Optional components

The following are optional, but not required:

- you may use an ORM library
- you may use a CSS framework

- you may have users and authentication
- you may use  a library to manage authentication and authortization

## Presentations

During the final weeks of class, your team will present your project to the

explain the code for one feature, and share challenges you faced in creating the
application.
