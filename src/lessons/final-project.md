# Final Project: Multi-model CRUD App

_Due Date: Mar 8_

For your final project, you'll work with a team design and build a complete web 
application.

More details will be shared later on.

<!--

> This is a **Team Project**. You'll work in groups of **2-3 students** to
> design and build your application.
>
> 1. Form your groups and communicate with your team before you accept the
>    assignment in Github Classroom.
> 2. Join the same team in Github Classroom. Work on your project together.
>    Ideally, find a time when you can all join a video call and work together on
>    the project. Everyone in the group should have a roughly equal contribution
>    to the project.
> 3. Submit your project as a group in Gradescope.

## Requirements

- Your application must use Flask or Express
- Your application must use a relational database (Postgresql is recommended, if you would like to deploy your application)
- Your application must have multiple related database models
- Your application must have features to Create, Read, Update, and Delete at least some of those models from a web interface
- Your application must be designed such that it works properly on different devices (desktop and mobile)

You must deploy a version of your application. In week 8, we'll cover deployment
in depth, and walk you through the steps to deploy your application.

## Optional components

The following are optional, but not required:

- you may use an ORM library
- you may use a CSS framework
- you may use an API
- you may have users and authentication
- you may use  a library to manage authentication and authortization
- you may deploy your application to the web

## Presentations

During the final weeks of class, your team will present your project to the
rest of the class. You'll have 5 minutes to share what the application does, 
explain the code for one feature, and share challenges you faced in creating the
application.
