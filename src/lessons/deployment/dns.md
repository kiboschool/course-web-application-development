# Domains and DNS

## Domain Names

To give your site a custom URL, you need to know more about **Domain Names.** Domain Names are how your browser finds the server to talk to.

To recap:

- The Domain Name System (DNS) is how your computer finds the address (like 162.159.135.42) like for a name (like kibo.school)
- DNS uses a *distributed hierarchy* of DNS servers. When one DNS server doesn‚Äôt know the answer, it asks another ‚Äúhigher‚Äù DNS server.
- üëë¬† ‚ÄúRoot‚Äù DNS servers manage the *top level domains,* like .com and .org

## What does it mean to own a domain name?

When someone buys a domain name, they get to decide which IP address the name points to. When Ope bought the [kibo.school](http://kibo.school) domain, she set the address to **162.159.135.42**. That‚Äôs the address of the Kibo server.

### Website building and publishing steps:

Making [kibo.school](http://kibo.school) involves these steps:

- Build the site (using HTML, CSS, and JS)
- Publish the site on a server
- Use DNS to make the [kibo.school](http://kibo.school) point to the server‚Äôs IP address

### How does your browser load kibo.school?

When you type [kibo.school](http://kibo.school) into your browser:

1. Your browser asks DNS for the address of [kibo.school](http://kibo.school), and gets back **162.159.135.42**
2. Your browser asks **162.159.135.42** for the actual webpage
3. The server at that address sends back the files that make up the site you see (HTML, CSS, and JS, plus images and videos)

## DNS Records

Now that we know what DNS is for, let‚Äôs talk a tiny bit about what it actually looks like. The graphic above showed the record like this:

![Kibo's IP Address](/images/dns-kibo.png)

At its heart, DNS is really simple: it matches a name and a value. In this case, the name `kibo.school` is matched with the value `162.159.135.42`

The actual DNS record looks like this:

```txt
kibo.school.		3600	IN	A	162.159.135.42
```

This says that `kibo.school` points to `162.159.135.42`. It‚Äôs also got some extra info:

- There‚Äôs an extra `.` after `kibo.school`
- There‚Äôs a **TTL** of `3600`
- It‚Äôs an `A` record

The extra dot means that it‚Äôs an *absolute* domain name. You can basically ignore this. (If it bugs you, you can read an explanation [here](http://www.dns-sd.org/trailingdotsindomainnames.html).)

**TTL** stands for ‚Äútime to live‚Äù and it says how long a DNS server should keep a copy of this record before it checks again. If it‚Äôs shorter, updates to the DNS record will show up faster, but the website might load slower for users.

**`A`** is the *type* of record.

**`IN`** means it's an INternet record. All DNS records are IN.

## Types of DNS Records

There are lots of different types of DNS records. Different types tell different kinds of information, like:

- The email server is located at this address (`MX` type records)
- This name points to a different name (`CNAME` type records)

`A` records match a domain name to an IP address. For matching the domain `[kibo.school](http://kibo.school)` to the address `162.159.135.42`, we use an `A` record.

As noted in the video, IP addresses like `162.159.135.42` are version 4 addresses. `AAAA` records are for IP version 6.
