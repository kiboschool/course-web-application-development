# Deploy a project

Each of these platforms will require you to create an account and do some configuration and setup, but offers a free tier for your application to run without paying.

> **Pick one of the tutorials below to deploy a web application.**
> - If you have an existing application to deploy, you can start with the Fly Speedrun.
> - If you would rather deploy an example application, try one of the examples for any of the platforms
> - After you've deployed an application, share it in a thread in Discord
> - If you want more practice, follow another tutorial to deploy to another platform

## Fly.io

Fly is a hosting provider that manages datacenters around the world. Deploying and running code close to your users means faster load times.

- Deploy an existing project using `flyctl`: [Fly Speedrun](https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/)

- [Tutorial: Deploy an example Flask app](https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/python/)

## Render

Render is a hosting provider focused on easy deployments, integrated into your `git` workflow.

- [Explore Render's docs to see how to deploy other apps](https://render.com/docs)

## Railway

Railway offers one-click deployments for template applications. It's a slightly different style than deploying with Fly or Render, but it's a nice way to explore and experiment with different kinds of applications.
