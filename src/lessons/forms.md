# Forms

Forms are among the most common modes of user interaction on the web. Any time
you want someone to enter some data online, a form is the go-to tool.

Forms make your web applications interactive. Forms are part of a multi-request
flow in your application. You'll see how different requests and responses work
together to create the normal user experience of filling out a form.

As you'll learn this week, there are lots of considerations when building forms!
What kinds of inputs should you use? What should happen when the form is
submitted? How do you check that the user has submitted valid information? How
do you make sure that the form works well on devices with different screen
sizes?

This week you'll also continue to learn more about relational databases and SQL,
practicing inserting and updating data in the database. In this week's
assignment, you'll see first-hand the importance of validating user input and
taking extreme care when crafting your queries, working with a SQL injection
attack.
