# Deployment

So far, the applications you've worked with in this class have run on your computer, and only you have been able to access them. Typical applications are accessible to users, and they run on servers, not just your computer.

This week, you'll learn how to deploy applications to cloud servers, and practice setting up your application so that it is accessible to the world.

Deployment also brings with it a number of new concerns. 

- If your code is running on a cloud server, how does it access the database? 
- How do you make changes?
- How do you see logs and errors?

All of these problems (and others) have standard solutions, and you'll take a peek into the world of managing real, living 
applications.
