# What are web applications?

A web application is a software application that runs on the web. It is accessed through a web browser, such as Google Chrome or Firefox, and can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as checking the weather, sending email, or sharing photos.

## HTTP Overview

Web applications work by sending and receiving data over the internet using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). When a user visits a web application in their web browser, their browser sends an HTTP request to the web application's server, asking for the data or content that the user wants to access. The server then processes the request and sends an HTTP response back to the user's browser, which contains the requested data or content.

HTTP is a protocol, or set of rules, that defines how web applications communicate over the internet. It specifies how requests and responses are formatted, and what actions should be taken in response to different types of requests. For example, an HTTP request might include a verb, such as GET or POST, that specifies what type of action the server should take, as well as a path that specifies which resource on the server the request is for. The HTTP response would then include a status code, such as 200 (OK) or 404 (Not Found), that indicates the result of the request.

Overall, the process of sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses is what allows web applications to provide users with dynamic, up-to-date content and functionality.
