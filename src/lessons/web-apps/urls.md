# URLs

Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are the _addresses_ of the web. They are a
shared format that programs can use to locate resources somewhere on the web.

URLs are made of these parts:

* **Scheme**: the protocol to use to request the resource
* **Authority** (Domain and Port): what server to request to get the resource
* **Path**: what resource is requested
* **Parameters**: key/value pairs, like the 'arguments' to a request
* **Anchor**: a 'bookmark' to a location within the resource
