# Practice: Web Applications

## HTTP Status Codes

Take another look at the [MDN guide to HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

First, make a list of the codes that you know already. These are probably the
most common codes.

Next, find a code that you aren't familiar with. Find more information on the 
situations when that status code is used.

Come up with a mental image you can use to remember the status code. You might
try looking it up on [HTTP status cats](https://http.cat/) or
[http.dog](https://http.dog/) for a particularly cute and memorable image.

## Link shortener: Run the apps

For the project this week, you will explore different versions of a link 
shortener application.

As a way to practice, clone [the source code for the application](https://github.com/kiboschool/link-shortener)
, and try to get a version of the application to run on your computer.

Start with setting up and running the Flask version. Then, try the Express
version. If you can run those, you can try the other implementations.

If you get stuck setting up and running any of the versions, ask for support on
Discord.

## Link shortener: Draw the app

Practice modeling web application architecture by drawing the link shortener
application.

Start by identifying the components of the application. Draw those components.

Next, find some of the requests and responses that the components send to each
other, and add them to your drawing.

## Flask Tutorial

In the first part of the course, you'll be using the Python web framework Flask.
Complete the [Flask Tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/) 
to get a sense of the basics of the framework.
