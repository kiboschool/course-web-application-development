### Submission

You are required to submit documentation for 10 practice exercises over the
course of the term. Each one will count for 1/10 of your practice grade, or 1%
of your overall grade.

To log your practice for credit:

> **[Submit a link using this form](https://forms.gle/z8GVWpkbPAtsu4b98)**

* Practice exercises will be graded for _completion_ not _correctness_. You have
to document that you did the work, but we won't be checking if you got it right.
* You are welcome to log practice that is not one of the exercises listed on the 
practice page.
* You can submit a link to a github repo, a replit, a Google doc, or some other 
resource.

Your log will count for credit as long as it:
- is accessible to your instructor
- shows your own work

### Exercise 1

**Objective**: Discover the underlying architecture of web applications through firsthand experience.

**Steps**:

1. **Pick Your App**: Select a web application you often use. It can be anything from Gmail, Facebook, to Dropbox, or any other platform you're fond of.

2. **Use and Observe**: 
   - Spend about 10-15 minutes interacting with your chosen app. It could also be reflecting on your past experiences with it.
   - Jot down all the different functionalities and features you notice (e.g., logging in, searching, retrieving data, submitting data).

3. **Break It Down**: 
   - For each feature you've noted, try to guess what's happening behind the scenes. What operations might be taking place on the server versus on your device (client-side)?
   - For instance, when you search for a friend on Facebook, ponder over the mechanisms working in the background to fetch that information for you.

4. **Data's Journey**:
   - Think about the origins of the data for each function. Is it being pulled from a database? Sourced from elsewhere? Maybe it's cached?
   - Sketch a basic flow diagram, showing how you believe data moves through the app, from the point of a user's request to its display on screen.

5. **Experience Matters**: 
   - Reflect on how the data is presented to you. Do you think there's any behind-the-scenes data tweaking to enhance the user experience?
   - Identify features that seem to prioritize performance (e.g., content that loads progressively, potential data compression).

6. **Outside Help**:
   - Do you notice any elements that hint at third-party integrations? For instance, some apps let you sign in using Google or Facebook. How do you think this integrates into the app's architecture?

7. **Show and Tell**:
   - Compile your insights into a brief presentation format. Your showcase should include:
     - A quick intro to your chosen web application.
     - An outline of its main features.
     - Your own architectural diagram, hypothesizing client-side, server-side, data movements, and possible third-party interactions.
     - Observations about design choices focused on user experience and performance.

8. **Discussion Time**:
   - Once everyone is done, you'll have an opportunity to share your findings and learn from others. This is a great chance to compare notes, identify common patterns, and ask questions about anything you're unsure about.


### Exercise 2
Create an deploy a Flask that shows a text: `Hello world` when you visit the `/` route.

Use `render` deploy provider. Paste the link of your deployed app into your submision document.
