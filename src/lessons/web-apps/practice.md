### Submission
To log your practice for credit:

> **[Submit on Gradescope](/assignments/week_1_practice_-_web_applications.pdf/)**

* Practice exercises will be graded for _completion_ not _correctness_. You have
to document that you did the work, but we won't be checking if you got it right.
* You are encouraged to engage with all the exercises listed on the 
practice page.
* You are expected to submit only the details requested on the Gradescope submission.

### Exercise 1

**Objective**: Discover the underlying architecture of web applications through firsthand experience.

**Steps**:

1. **Pick Your App**: Select a web application you often use. It can be anything from Gmail, Facebook, to Dropbox, or any other platform you're fond of.

2. **Use and Observe**: 
   - Spend about 10-15 minutes interacting with your chosen app. It could also be reflecting on your past experiences with it.
   - Jot down all the different functionalities and features you notice (e.g., logging in, searching, retrieving data, submitting data).

3. **Break It Down**: 
   - For each feature you've noted, try to guess what's happening behind the scenes. What operations might be taking place on the server versus on your device (client-side)?
   - For instance, when you search for a friend on Facebook, ponder over the mechanisms working in the background to fetch that information for you.

4. **Data's Journey**:
   - Think about the origins of the data for each function. Is it being pulled from a database? Sourced from elsewhere? Maybe it's cached?
   - Sketch a basic flow diagram, showing how you believe data moves through the app, from the point of a user's request to its display on screen.

5. **Experience Matters**: 
   - Reflect on how the data is presented to you. Do you think there's any behind-the-scenes data tweaking to enhance the user experience?
   - Identify features that seem to prioritize performance (e.g., content that loads progressively, potential data compression).

6. **Outside Help**:
   - Do you notice any elements that hint at third-party integrations? For instance, some apps let you sign in using Google or Facebook. How do you think this integrates into the app's architecture?

7. **Show and Tell**:
   - Compile your insights into a brief presentation format. Your showcase should include:
     - A quick intro to your chosen web application.
     - An outline of its main features.
     - Your own architectural diagram, hypothesizing client-side, server-side, data movements, and possible third-party interactions.
     - Observations about design choices focused on user experience and performance.




### Exercise 2
Create and deploy a Flask app that shows a text: `Hello world` when you visit the `/` route.

Use the `render` deploy provider. Paste the link of your deployed app into the Gradescope submission.
