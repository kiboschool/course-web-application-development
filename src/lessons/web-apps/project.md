# Assignment: Web App Tour

## Web App Tour

In this project, you won't be writing code. Instead, you'll be exploring
different versions of a web application. 

The different versions use different languages and frameworks, but all have the 
same features and functionality. 

Your task will be to answer questions about these different versions of the 
application by exploring the source code.

> _Polyglot_ means 'many tongues'. 
>
> This project, and this whole course, will use
> multiple languages - primarily Python and JavaScript, but also others.
> Different languages and frameworks may have different syntax, but they can
> be used to create the same features.
> 
> By comparing different languages and frameworks, you will learn the core
> components of _any_ web application. That way, even if you encounter an
> unfamiliar framework or language, you'll still know what to look for.

## Submission
