# Assignment: Web App Tour

## Web App Tour

In this project, you won't be writing code. Instead, you'll be exploring
different versions of a web application. 

The different versions use different languages and frameworks, but all have the 
same features and functionality. 

Your task will be to answer questions about these different versions of the 
application by exploring the source code.

* [Live demo of the application](https://ls.up.railway.app/)
* [Source code of the different implementations](https://github.com/kiboschool/link-shortener)

How do you read code? Check out this [section from C4S](https://c4s.vercel.app/communicating-for-success/reading-well/reading-technical-writing.html#code) about reading code for tips. Be sure to check out the [video on reading code](https://youtu.be/xZZ74d8XUl0) with Felienne Hermans.
