# Assignments

## Submission

Each of your assignments must be submitted in Gradescope and Woolf. For projects
with a Github link, you should also push the latest version of your code to
Github Classroom.

This video shows how to get assignment code onto your computer, and how to
submit it to Github Classroom.

## Grading

Your overall course grade is made up of the following:

- Practice Exercises: 10%
- Weekly assignments: 40%
- Midterm Project: 25%
- Final Project: 25%

Each of the weekly assignments counts for 4% of your overall grade.

## Late Assignments

The assignments in the course build on each other. It is important to turn
your work in on time, both for your own learning, and as a matter of
professionalism.

If you know that you will not be able to submit an assignment on time, please
contact the instructor to provide the reason and ask for an extension.

In general, the penalty for late submission of an assignment is 10% of the
assignment grade, per week that the assignment is late, with a max penalty of
50% per assignment.

## Practice Exercises

Each week will include practice exercises to help you better understand web
applications. You are _strongly_ encouraged to complete the practice exercises
each week. They will be graded based on completion, not correctness. Submitting
any of the practice exercises for a given week will count towards the practice
exercise grade for the course. 

## Why practice?

Practice coding helps you become a great coder. These practice problems aren't
graded, but that doesn't mean they aren't important.

You should aim to practice a lot, especially with unfamiliar concepts. Spread practice over multiple days to take advantage of the _spacing effect_, which helps you retain new knowledge.

<details><summary>More about practice</summary>

Practice helps you understand what you know, and what you don't know. It can be easy to trick yourself into thinking you understand something when you
do not -- or that you don't understand when you do. Practicing by writing code
or debugging code will help you find out what you really understand, and where
you are still confused.

Practice helps build confidence in your coding. The more programs you write, and
the more problems you solve, the more you learn that you are a capable coder and
problem-solver.

Practice doesn't always feel good - sometimes you'll be stumped! But, practice
shouldn't feel super frustrating either. If you find yourself getting angry at
yourself or the code, it's a good time to take a break and ask for help. 

On the flip side, if practice feels too easy, it means you aren't challenging yourself
enough. If the practice problems early in the course are not challenging for
you, you should seek additional challenges.
